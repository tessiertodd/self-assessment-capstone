## Self-Assessment:
The roles I played throughout the project evolved as we worked through the process. I was able to get some salary information from a *Statistics Canada* website as well as some real estate data from regions across Canada from *The Canadian Real Estate Association* website. While we didn’t use this real estate data, I did have to learn Excel functions in pandas as I had to pull in data from 80+ tabs into one file in Python. Goutham scraped real estate data from Listings.ca website, which I worked to help clean/transform the scraped data in Python working with data in DataFrames and regex to extract some data into columns of information we could analyze.  I also added the initial code to load the Dataframes that we had into Postgres SQL database. I then shifted gears to work on the front-end with data in JavaScript/HTML to build charts with our data as part of our dashboard.  While I really enjoyed the challenge of the Python cleaning work early on, the JavaScript work was by far the most challenging, but finally getting the data into a chart driven by a dropdown menu for user was truly a great feeling - still some things that didn’t work out 100% to plan but very rewarding to get dashboard where it is today! 

## Team-Assessment:
This project was first and foremost a collaborative effort between the entire group.  Our team met regularly (class nights, Saturday or Sunday AM, occasionally another weeknight) - our meetings were for updates on where we were, to discuss challenges we were having and decide what each of us was to do and work to complete for our next connect.  Between our meetings we used the Group 6 slack channel quite a bit to communicate between ourselves and ask question of Rebecca (our very helpful TA).  We aligned on our overall objective as a team, which kept us moving forward, even when we started to get stuck in certain areas (ie. moved forward on idea with best data of one we explored).  We managed to get a lot of what we had planned done, but still some things we would do if we had more time.

It truly was a pleasure working with **Goutham Aiyappan, Érico Sabino and Shakti Chavda** – an amazing group of people that made this process very enjoyable and rewarding!  Thanks everyone!

## Summary of the Project:
We focused on trying bring in real estate and salary information to help people who are looking to move and/or choose a career get information.  We were able to display some of the real estate and salary information in an interactive website where people can choose where to live and work.

We used the features we could get from the real estate data we had to look at K-means clustering machine learning model to help people to understand where the factors that impacted housing prices and where the similar cluster of houses were geographically relative to other houses in the same cluster.  Our assessment of the real estate market information led us to the conclusion that while the numbers of bed and bathrooms definitely play a role in the price of houses, the geographic location impact price. 

One of the other things we discovered through this project is the challenge to get data that we could use for the analysis, I believe we ended up having to eliminate at least 25% of the records we started with for various reasons, leavings us with much less data that we started with for our analysis.
